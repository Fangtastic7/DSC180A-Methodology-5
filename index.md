**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic is definitely smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially vending machines, where the user is interacting with the code. 
With a selection and money, they can get the snacks from the machine. These contracts serve as the basis for the project and is the core logic of all
the transactions that occur.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation for the Q2 project is incorporating the smart contract alongside IPFS (a decentralized cloud storage) into an interactable marketplace. 
It will involve users to make transactions with other users while also being to interact with the website by viewing the data that they have. This will require
a lot of testing between different users.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

We have many group members working independently on separate tools, but for the project, integration is key. We need maybe a system that involves us to 
integrate and put our work together as we are building the product. This way, there will be no conflicts and things will run smoothly. In addition, we
have to plan ahead and make sure everything we do is defined within a scope.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Encryption is definitely one of them, but it may be very difficult. Encryption techniques like ZK-Proofs is very hard to implement and our mentor advised it 
to be optional. I would want to check it out, but it really depends on the time we have. Another technique is an auction feature of the marketplace. 
My group does have a general idea of implementing another smart contract, but this also depends on whether or not be complete the baseline goals of the 
project.
